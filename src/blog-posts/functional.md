title: Getting Flexible with Functional Languages

In high school, I always thought of myself as a “talented” software developer (whatever that means). I thought that introductory CS classes would be a breeze in college, and I would have to buckle down and wait out the first few classes before things got really interesting.

Well I was proved completely wrong as I read up on my first CS class, and found out that it would be taught in a completely functional language.
As a first-year computer science student at Northeastern University, I’m taking Fundamentals of Computer Science in a subset of “teaching languages” made in Racket, a programming language for making programming languages. Unlike my AP Computer Science: A experience in high school, this class didn’t just focus on arrays and for loops (in fact neither even exist in the Teaching Languages). I learned a so-called Design Recipe: a step by step way of thinking that helps you really think about the purpose and design of data and functions. Whether its writing function signatures (type-hinting) or templates to process data in an idiomatic way, this class has totally changed my perspective on building programs.

I can’t wait to learn more from this course and continue through the rest of the introductory classes at Northeastern and have my preconceptions of software development warped and challenged along the way.
