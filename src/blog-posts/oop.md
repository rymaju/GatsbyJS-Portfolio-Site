AP Computer Science A wasn’t my first look at computer science, but it was the first real computer science class that I ever took. The program taught me Java, object-oriented design, all the good and important things like for-loops and inheritance and encapsulation – or so I thought.

No, for-loops, inheritance over composition and an emphasis on classes is not a particularly good introduction to object-oriented programming. I learned this the hard way by taking Northeastern’s introduction to object-oriented design. Again, this class would be in Java, but the content and scaffolding would be completely different. Rather than the course being a tour of Java, it simply used Java as a window into the important topic of object-oriented design. Instead of focusing on inheritance by sub classing, we used interfaces to create our union data. Polymorphism wasn’t scary or complicated, but a simple extension of being able to dispatch a method onto a type of union data and allowing the implementation of the union data (the class that implements the interface) to do the rest of the work. Field of field access was forbidden, and so was mutation.

And so instead of working with mutable structures and learning for-loop idioms, we were able to spend more time genuinely understanding recursion and good object-oriented design. While I appreciate and still use the tools that APCS taught me, they were just that: unopinionated tools. While continuing my education at Northeastern, I learned how and why to apply those tools in a more idiomatic and better designed way.
