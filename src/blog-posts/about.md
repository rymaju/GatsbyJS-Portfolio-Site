If you managed to get to this page, you must be curious about who I am and what my background is. Thanks for caring enough to learn a bit more about me, I'll try not to bore you.

My computer science journey started in 9th grade when I experiment with game development using Unity3D. Back then, I was obsessed with game development and even managed to start my own game development club. I became pretty good at making mediocre games, and by some stroke of luck I got my first job creating a game exhibit that allowed students and teachers to experience brand new high school facility redesigns in virtual reality! It took a while to get the HTC Vive set up, but it was my first real "job" and I was able to apply my computer science skills in a way that impacted other people, which is what inspired me to pursue my computer science major at Northeastern University (Go Huskies!).

Over time, I branched out into other areas of computer science including web development and cybersecurity. Thanks to friends and mentors much more intelligent and kinder than me, I was able to participate in CTFs and Hackathons. As of right now, I'm most passionate about web development and creating well designed bespoke solutions to people's website needs.

In terms of things not computer science related, I enjoy spending hours talking with close friends on video calls who live far away and I also like teaching! Some of my most fulfilling high school memories were from when I acted as a teaching assistant in the classroom.

In the next few years, I hope to learn more at college and create some meaningful projects, hopefully becoming a better programmer somewhere along the way.
